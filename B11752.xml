         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAST DESCRIPTION OF THE SIEGE OF BREDA, WHICH IS NOW ENVIRONED BY THE Forces of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnder the Command of the Marqueſſe SPINOLA: And a delineation of the Campe of the high and mightie States of the Vnited Prouinces, who ſent lately the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the foure Engliſh Colonels, and the <hi>Duke of</hi> BRVNSVVICKE, <hi>to relieue the Towne.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>GEntle Reader, you haue here the ſiege of the ſtrong Towne of <hi>Breda,</hi> with all the fortifications and out-workes of it, beſides the declarations of them. This Towne of <hi>Breda</hi> lyeth three leagues from <hi>Geertruydenberg,</hi> and as many from <hi>Seuenber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen:</hi> 3. leagues and a halfe from <hi>Oudenboſch,</hi> 5. leagues from <hi>Rooſendael,</hi> 6. leagues and a halfe from <hi>Bergen vp Zoome, Turnhout,</hi> and <hi>S'hertogenhoſch,</hi> 9. leagues from <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> 16. leagues and a halfe from <hi>Lillo,</hi> 9. leagues and a halfe from <hi>Lier:</hi> It is a faire and ſtately Towne, and of a reaſonable bigneſſe, and hath a ſtately Pallace, which is belonging to the Counts of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> whoſe Tombes are both in the Church and Caſtle to be ſeene. It is mightily ſtrengthened and fortified ſince it was laſt of all taken by the States of the vnited Prouinces.</p>
            <p>But to come to the ſiege of <hi>Breda,</hi> it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly knowne how that his Excellency the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> hauing cauſed many horſe and foot to meet on the 19. and 20. of Iuly about <hi>Lier,</hi> he went preſently towards <hi>Hooch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraeten,</hi> and when hee had fortified it, and <hi>Turnhout,</hi> hee inquartered his forces in the villages of <hi>Chaem, Baerle, Alphe</hi> and <hi>Gilſen,</hi> and let them lie there vntill the midſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, about which time he ſent Count <hi>Henry Vanden Berg</hi> towards the Towne of Graue, and cauſed Count <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to march likewiſe thitherwards, with many thouſand foot, and a thouſand of horſe to make a ſhew as if he would haue beſieged the ſame Town. But on the 26. of Auguſt his Excellencie the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> ſent the Colonell <hi>Don Franciſco de Medina</hi> with his Regiment, with many other Companies, and 1000. horſe.</p>
            <p>The 27. of Auguſt came the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> with his whole Armie before the Towne of <hi>Breda,</hi> and he pitcht his owne tent preſently downe in the village of <hi>Ginneken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 28. of this Moneth the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> appointed his Armie to be deuided in three ſeuerall quarters and to bee layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The firſt quarter extendeth from the Boſchgate vnto the gate that leadeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tetteringen,</hi> and continueth vnto the Riuer of Marke, which was giuen to Signeor <hi>paulo Baglioni</hi> who hath vnder him his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Italians, beſides other Italians, and 5000. Wallons, which began to intrench themſelues preſently. And it happened that the ſame day about noone there were twelue Barkes and a Pinnace by the Spaniſh taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>ter Heyden</hi> being bound for <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And afterwards Signior <hi>Baglioni</hi> laide a ſtrong bridge vpon the afore mentioned Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and raiſed two forts of each ſide.</p>
            <p>The ſecond quarter is at <hi>Ginneken,</hi> in which village is the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> &amp; the Count of <hi>Salaſar</hi> lodged, beſides diuers other Lords</p>
            <p>The third quarter is in the village called <hi>ter Hage,</hi> and ſtandeth vnder the command of Count <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> who is ſome 5000. men ſtrong both horſe and foot.</p>
            <p>The 30. of Auguſt began the Spaniſh to make fiue royall Forts beſides many Redouts and Sconces round about the Towne.</p>
            <p>The ſixth of September was the towne wholy enuironed, notwithſtanding that they within made ſallies, and playd continually with their Ordnance vpon the trenches and other works of their approaching enemies.</p>
            <p>The Prince of Orange hauing vnderſtood that the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> meant earneſt with the ſiege of <hi>Breda</hi> (ſeeing that hee had not only compaſt it about with many Forts, Redouts, and ſtrong Trenches, but ſent more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer for more aid) he gathered preſently all his old ſouldiers, with the forces of the foure Engliſh Colonels, and marcht vp with them as if hee would haue beſieged either <hi>Weſel, Goch</hi> or <hi>Berch,</hi> but altering his courſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very ſuddenly, vpon ſome aduiſes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his Excellency, he came downe with his whole Armie with an intention to relieue <hi>Breda,</hi> and ſat downe with it on the 29. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember at a village which is called <hi>ter Heiden,</hi> being but a league from <hi>Breda,</hi> and hauing muſtred his forces he got ſome companies of his in the Towne. And wee haue euen now gotten tidings that the Prince of Orange hath made an aſſault vpon the Campe of the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> and defeated many of his ſouldiers, but ſpecially in the quarter of Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Paulo Baglioni,</hi> although the Marqueſſe got lately 5000. foot &amp; 1000. horſe of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Tilly</hi> in his campe, beſides Count <hi>Henrie Vanden Berg</hi> with his whole Armie.</p>
